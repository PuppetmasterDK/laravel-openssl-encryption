laravel-openssl-encryption
==========================

Laravel 4 encryption package that uses the PHP openssl extension.

It can replace the default Laravel 4 encryption core package that uses the PHP mcrypt extension.

It has been created to run Laravel 4 apps on the [Google App Engine for PHP](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/php/) platform that currently (may 2013) does not support the mcrypt extension.
